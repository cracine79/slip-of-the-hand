# slip-of-the-hand


## Background

A Slip of the Hand occurs when one attempts to type a word or phrase into a keyboard, but with one or both hands mispositioned, accidentally resulting in a different, but real word or phrase. For example, if you were trying to type the word "DEWS" into the keyboard, but your left hand happened to be mistakenly mispositioned one key to the right, this would result in you typing the word "FRED."  In this example, the word requires only one hand to type (all keys are left hand keys), and as such only one hand is mispositioned.  We could have other variations of slips of the hand where only one hand is mispositioned, but the word requires both hands to type, for example "GRIN" and "GRUB", where the left hand is positioned correctly, thus typing out "GR", but the right hand is mispositioned by one key position to the left.  Or a more eggregious example could be "GOD" and "TIE", where the left hand is mispositioned one key upwards, and the right hand is mispositioned one key to the left.

Slips of the Hand can be categorized as follows:

Category I: One hand mispositioned   <br>
Category II: Both hands mispositioned, but in the same direction <br>
Category III: Both hands mispositioned, but in different directions


A Slip of the Hand app will allow users to enter a word or a phrase.  It will then search for all possible slips of the hand that could have resulted from typing in this pattern, but with one or boht hands mispositioned.  It will then return to the user all possible slips of the hand for that word.  For example, if the user entered the word "TO", the app will return "GO, DO, SO, , ...etc."

## Functionality & MVPs

In A Slip of the Hand, users will be able to: 
<ul>
  <li>See a demonstration of a slip of the hand on the explanation homepage</li>
  <li>Choose a tab to see a further explanation of Slip of the Hand Rules (e.g. no crossovers, treatment of shift and CAPS LOCK)</li>
  <li>Enter in a word or phrase and have returned all possible resulting Slips of the Hand</li>
  <li>Order/group the resulting list of Slips of the Hand by category</li>
  <li>See a demonstration of how their original word resulted in the returned Slips of the Hand with the relevant hand mispositioning</li>
</ul>

In addition, this project will also strive to include:
